## 状语从句
### 构成
1. 引导词 + 状语从句 + “ ，” + 主句（状语从句放句首时，必须加逗号）
2. 主句 + 引导词 + 状语从句（状语从句放在主句后，可加逗号也可不加）
### 分类
  - 状语从句的引导词是按照**引导词本身的意思**分的类，一共分为九类
#### 时间状语从句
1. 引导词
   + when = while = as 
     > 当 **" while "** 翻译为 **“ 当...的时候 ”**，后面要跟进行时态
   + before
   + after
   + since
     > I have fallen in love with you,since I meet you.  
   + the moment = as soon as
   + by the time
   + until
   + not...until
2. 时态
   > When love comes,I will hold her hands
   
   + **“主将从现” **：在所有的状语从句中，如果主句的动作和从句的动作都尚未发生的话，**主句**用**一般将来时**，**从句**用**一般现在时**表示将来。

   > When love came,I failed to hold her hands.
3. 区别 **"until"** 和 **"not...until"**
   > I will wait here until you come.

   > I will not leave until you come.
   + 看**主句**的**谓语动词**是**延续性动词**还是**瞬间动词**，如果是**延续性动词就用"until"**，如果是个**瞬间动词就用"not...until"**。
4. **"When"** 引导的时间状语从句省略的情况
   > When ~~I was~~ a kid,I enjoy singing songs.
+ **"When"** 引导的时间状语从句，如果主句和从句的主语一致，并且从句谓语中有 **“be动词”**，此时，从句的**主语和be动词**可以同时省略。


#### 地点状语从句
+ 做地点状语的通常都是介词短语，很少是从句
+ 引导词：where
  > The kind of trees grow well in moist places.

  > The kind of trees grow well where it is moist.

#### 目的状语从句
1. 动词不定式：to、in order to、so as to

   > "so that" 表示目的，通常放在句末，不放在句首
+ 例句

#### 结果状语从句
1. 引导词：so ... that、such ... that
   + "so" + adj./adv. + that **替换** "very" +adj./adv.
   + "such" + n.

   > My mother proves so kind that she is respected by all her staff.
#### 让步状语从句

  - **" as "** 部分
    - as + n. 
      > "as" 可译为 **“ 作为 ”**
    - v. + n. + as 
      > "as" 的意思取决于前面 **" v. "** 的意思
    - as + 句子  
      > "as" 可译为“当...的时候”、“因为”、“虽然...尽管”、“好像”，"似乎"、"和...一样"
  - **" than "** 部分

## 考点分析
### 写作
+ 作文中任何一句话都可以加一个状语把句子拉长。
  > I love you **for my whole life**.
  
  > One can live as if he were a pig conversely,he can never be as delighted as a pig.
### 长难句分析
+ 能够快速识别一句话中的状语成分，并通顺的翻译出来。
+ 只要在句子中见到以下的成分就一定是状语
   - 副词
   - 比较状语
   - 条件状语
   - 结果
   - 原因
   - 让步
   - 目的
   - 方式
   - 伴随：with
+ 见到 **“ n. + 时间或地点 ”** 需要区别定语还是状语
  > I love a boy in Tinghua university.
  - 如果无法确定是状语还是定语时，优先判断为定语。只有在翻译为定语时语句不通顺的情况下判定为状语。
