## 名词性从句
+ 名词在句子中能够充当的成分，名词从句都可以充当，故分为**四类**
  + 主语从句
    > What I saw looks terrific.
  + 宾语从句
    > I admine what she said.
  + 表语从句
    > Gump is who we should learn from.
  + 同位语从句
    > I enjoy the part that a bird is flying.
+ 引导词的分类
  - 名词性从句的引导词是按照从句的类型分的类，共分为三类，并且英语中所有的从句都是陈述句的形式，也就是 “ 引导词 + 主语 + 谓语 “ 的形式
    1. " that "：当从句是陈述句时，并且 " that " 在从句中不充当任何成分也没有任何意思；
       > That he has got divorced is my fault.

       > That ladies tend to be right,remains common knowledge.
    2. " whether "：当从句是一般疑问句时，并且 " whether " 在从句中不充当任何成分，译为是否；
       > Whether has got divorced is obvious.

       > Whether he has got divorced is obvious.

       > I am wondering whether aliens exist.
    3. 所有的特殊疑问词：当从句是特殊疑问句时。
       > Who will he marry is a secret.
### 考点分析
+ **主语从句**
  - 把主语从句放到句末，加 **" it "** 来做**形式主语**
  - 满分句型：
    - It ... that ...
    - It is apparent that ...
    - It looks beyond dispute that ... 
    - It keeps my argument that ...
    - It is universally acknowledged that ...
  > It looks beyond dispute that the issue about diligence has been brought into the limelight. 
+ **同位语从句**
  - 同位语从句既可以放在他所解释的名词后，也可以放到整句话的后面。
  > The matter that he managed to find a girlfriend makes his superiors rejoiced.  
  
  > Nothing can hide the truth that she is getting old.
  
  > The outlook proves wrong that private individuals in HK seem all deceivers
